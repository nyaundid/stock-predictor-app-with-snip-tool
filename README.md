The Stock Predictor App is a user-friendly tool designed to assist traders and investors in making informed decisions. With the ability to capture real-time stock chart data through a 'Snip' feature, the app utilizes advanced machine learning models, including a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Random Forest classifier. Users can predict market movements by clicking the 'Predict' button, which triggers the analysis of the captured chart. The app then combines predictions from both models, displaying a clear 'BUY' or 'SELL' recommendation in a central position on the screen. Additionally, users can access supplementary information to enhance their understanding of the prediction. The Stock Predictor App provides a seamless and interactive experience for users seeking accurate and timely insights into stock market trends.
